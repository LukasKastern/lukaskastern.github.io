<h2 id="project---zig-patch-github">Project - Zig Patch (<a href="https://github.com/LukasKastern/zig-patch">github</a>)</h2>
<p>I created this project with the goal in mind of integrating it into Journee’s tec stack. Sadly during my time at Journee we didn’t find time for this.</p>
<p>Zig-Patch is a tool that creates and applies binary patches of game builds. It is based on the <a href="https://docs.itch.ovh/wharf/master/">wharf spec</a>.</p>
<p>It simply tries to find 64kb blocks that didn’t changed inbetween two versions. If it finds a matching block in the previous build it can use that instead of serializing the data.</p>
<p>To make the patching process as fast as possible I used async-io to read / write data while worker threads handle diffing and compression or decompression of changed blocks.</p>
<h3 id="showcase">Showcase</h3>
<p>In the following video I built two versions of Unreal’s lyra project. The only difference being a change to a single level.</p>
<p>The build of the lyra project was 872mb in total. The patch was created in 0.46 seconds, was 5.65 mb big and took 1.23 seconds to be applied.</p>

<h2 id="project---operation-valor-steam">Project - Operation Valor (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1095480/Operation_Valor/">steam</a>)</h2>
<p>Operation Valor is a 54 player Unity multiplayer game that I built with my two co-founders at One Dawn Studios.</p>

<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
<p>When we started working on the Project Unity didn’t really have a solution for non-casual Multiplayer games. But luckily for us Unity just released their <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/FPSSample">fps sample</a> which we then used as a base of the Project.</p>
<p>Of course the fps sample is rather opionated so we had to tweak / change a lot of things.</p>
<p>But Unity then released Netcode for DOTS which we then started migrating towards.</p>
<h2 id="project---vk-backbuffer-capture-github">Project - vk-backbuffer-capture (<a href="https://github.com/LukasKastern/vk-backbuffer-capture">github</a>)</h2>
<p>This project originated by the need for low latency frame capturing of games running under proton during my time at Journee.</p>
<p>The core of the project is a vulkan layer that is loaded by the vulkan loader during game startup.</p>
<p>A client that wants to get the frames of the game can then use the SDK that is part of the project.</p>
<p>This SDK then communicates with the target app using a shared memory object. The frames are exported using opaque_fd handles and can be imported by the client without having to move the data to the CPU.</p>
<h2 id="project---structure-2d-github">Project - Structure 2D (<a href="https://github.com/LukasKastern/structure-2d">github</a>)</h2>
<p>Structure 2D was supposed to be a framework for creating 2D cell based games.</p>
<p>But I never got to properly release it.</p>
<p>It supported dynamic cell lighting, a save system, parallax background, map editing tools, procedural map generation as well as a collider system.</p>
<p>Rendering happened in a single fullscreen rendering pass.</p>
